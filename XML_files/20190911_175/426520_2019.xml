This team acts as a custodian for the countywide model (COMET) which is the current transport model for informing current and future transport patterns and demand across Hertfordshire. Developed in collaboration with the existing Transport Planning Framework provider, COMET was created in line with national guidance, specifically the Department for Transport’s Web Transport Analysis Guidance (WebTAG). COMET consists of a suite of models including an EMME based Variable demand and passenger transport model and a Saturn based highway model. Having a countywide model such as COMET provides a means of identifying the impact of future development on the transport network and ensuring that growth in Hertfordshire is good growth, enabling the Council to identify future areas of stress and scenario test scheme options. With the Council planning a pipeline of medium and major-sized schemes, having a countywide model such as COMET in place will only grow in relevance going forwards. As such, by supporting the maintenance and development of a countywide modelling function, the chosen supplier will play an active role in supporting ‘good growth’ in Hertfordshire.</P><P>Please note: The TUPE Staffing Information for this procurement has been provided along with other documentation for this procurement.
